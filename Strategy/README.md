# Object Oriented Strategy Pattern
Check [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy) for more information about the pattern.

## Opinions
This pattern is very powerful, it is my most used pattern and it can be applied for so many things.
In many cases it doesn't really need to be a whole class either, a simple mapping function is basically the same.
A different approach is just have Func\<T, TResult> strategy or any other delegate instead.
