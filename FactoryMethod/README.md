# Object Oriented Factory Method Pattern
Check [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method) for more information about the pattern.

## Opinion
This creational pattern is a very useful pattern, along with strategy pattern one of my most used ones, it gives you a defined behavior on how to construct an object.
In many cases this can be replaced with a Func\<T> if its not expected to have a difficult creation.
I find it very useful if i want create something where i have some parameters to put into the creational logic.
